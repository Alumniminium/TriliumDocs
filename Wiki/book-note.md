# Book Notes in Trilium

A **Book Note** in Trilium is a special type of [note](note.md) designed to display the contents of its child notes sequentially, creating a linear, book-like reading experience. This format is particularly useful for viewing multiple smaller notes in a cohesive, continuous manner.

In the example above, the "node.js" note on the left panel contains several child notes. The right panel displays the content of these child notes as a single continuous document.

## Features

### Linear Display

The Book Note format compiles the contents of all child notes into one continuous view. This makes it ideal for reading extensive information broken into smaller, manageable segments.

### Grid View Option

Trilium also offers a "Grid View" option within the Book Note properties. This view presents the child notes in a grid format, allowing for a more visual navigation experience.

Switching between these views can be easily managed through the Book Note's settings, allowing users to choose the format that best suits their reading or navigation preferences.
