# Advanced Showcases

Trilium offers advanced functionality through [Scripts](scripts.md) and [Promoted Attributes](promoted-attributes.md). To illustrate these features, we've prepared several showcases available in the [demo document](document.md):

* [Relation Map](relation-map.md)
* [Day Notes](day-notes.md)
* [Weight Tracker](weight-tracker.md)
* [Task Manager](task-manager.md)

It's important to note that these examples are not natively supported by Trilium out of the box; instead, they demonstrate what you can build within Trilium.
