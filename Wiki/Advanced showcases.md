# Advanced showcases
Trilium provides some advanced functionality in the form of [Scripts](Scripts.md) and [promoted attributes](Promoted%20attributes.md). To explain and visualize these features we've prepared few showcases which are also available in the [demo document](Document.md):

*   [Relation map](Relation-map.md)
*   [Day notes](Day-notes.md)
*   [Weight Tracker](Weight-tracker.md)
*   [Task Manager](Task-manager.md)

An important thing to keep in mind is that above showcases and demoed functionality are not built-in into Trilium - these are just examples of Trilium's extensibility.
